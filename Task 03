3. Write a Python function to show the first â€˜nâ€™ even numbers and then return the sum and product of that even numbers outside the function.

def even_numbers(n):
    even_list = [2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    print("First", n, "even numbers:", even_list)
    return sum(even_list), product(even_list)

def product(numbers):
    result = 1
    for num in numbers:
        result *= num
    return result


n = int(input("Enter how many even numbers you want: "))
sum_even, prod_even = even_numbers(n)
print("Sum of even numbers:", sum_even)
print("Product of even numbers:", prod_even)
